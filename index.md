## Abstract
Unconventional superconductors hold considerable potential for next-generation technologies. In particular, $p$-wave spin-triplet superconductors can host distinctive phenomena such as topological edge states and spin-polarized supercurrents, making them attractive for quantum and spintronic devices. However, a major practical limitation is that $p$-wave superconducting phases typically emerge only at very low critical temperatures $T_c$, which makes their experimental realization and technological integration challenging. To address this, we consider layered nanostructures constructed from materials with different properties. Such heterostructures provide a versatile platform in which different pairing symmetries, energy scales, and interfacial couplings can be engineered to realize phases and properties not available in bulk materials. The goal of the present thesis is to lay the theoretical and numerical foundation for a forthcoming master’s thesis, in which we will investigate proximity systems with the aim of stabilizing the exotic triplet state at relatively high temperatures without polluting the $p$-wave superconductor with other symmetries.

We begin with a comprehensive review of the tight-binding model, the extended Hubbard model, and the fundamental mechanisms underlying ferromagnetism and superconductivity, and we implement these models numerically. Next, we introduce the Bogoliubov--de Gennes formalism, along with the corresponding self-consistent equations applicable to both conventional and unconventional superconducting systems. Focusing on on-site singlet pairing, we solve these equations iteratively to determine the superconducting band gap and critical temperature. We then explore the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism; in particular, we investigate magnetic frustration and the Ruderman--Kittel--Kasuya--Yosida (RKKY) interaction in a triangular lattice with symmetrically placed spins. To the best of our knowledge, this specific frustrated RKKY configuration has not been investigated previously and therefore constitutes a novel result. We finish by introducing the concept of proximity effects with some common examples of such systems, such as SN/SF junctions and Josephson junctions.
